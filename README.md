The project uses Random Forest regression, with Gradient Boosting for comparison, on a 66,000+ row dataset from 5 key Middle Eastern cities (Riyadh, Dubai, Cairo, Doha, and Kuwait). It aims to support traffic managers and urban planners by optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion, enhancing urban mobility in the region.
